Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.CI automatically builds and tests your code as you push it to GitHub, preventing bugs from being deployed to production.
